Recap of Python Learning discussion at Sept 2012 Meetup
=======================================================

To kick off the discussion, Peter presented slides describing a basic breakdown of possible ways APUG can help people learn Python: <a href="https://github.com/awpug/apug/blob/master/talks/Python%20Learning%20Meetup.pdf">Python Learning Meetup.pdf</a>

The main ideas for learning activities that APUG could engage in were:

 * Traditional lecture-style tutorials
 * Open office hours, where a few experts will be physically present and available to answer people's questions about Python.
 * Project-based learning: Helping people improve their Python skills by tackling a meaningful project, like building a web application or writing a game.
 * Augmenting web tutorial videos with study groups and workshops


Major themes/ideas
==================

 * We need a way to teach people the unknown unknowns.  Related to this is teaching people how to "ask the right questions on Google", as a programmer or as a Python programmer.
 * There is lots of value to in-person interaction: can see when people are lost or confused, can better communicate complex ideas, etc.  Just providing additional "virtual" content online is not really taking advantage of the physical co-location of APUG members.
 * We can create a resource page for total beginners, but what about intermediate learners?  The "yellow belt" or novice-to-intermediate transition lacks materials and support.
 * "Dojo" model: Beginner courses to teach the basics, then weekly practice for novice, intermediate, and advanced users to learn from each other. Maybe specially designed "advanced" courses. But the focus is on practice and learning, and not merely exposition.
 * How do we effectively match mentors and learners?
 * How do we ensure that we respect mentors' time and energies?  E.g. make sure we publicize their availability and really drive learners to utilitize their expertise, so they don't just sit around bored.  Also, we should establish some sort of filter (monetary or certifying completion of a web tutorial or something) to make sure that the learner is actually committed to be fully engaged and doesn't "flake out".

Thoughts from APUG members who want to learn Python
===================================================

 * Would prefer to work on a piece of a larger project
 * Would learn a lot from looking at code and doing "code reviews" or "walkthroughs"
 * Some way to give learners immediate feedback when they get stuck; like #sqlhelp or the JS Hotline
 * PythonAnywhere / EC2 Python shell to be able to use Python hassle-free
 * Talks about tools of the trade, tooling, workflow for effective Python development
 * Helpdesk; trying to use Python to solve real-world problems

Ideas for modifying APUG meetings
=================================
 * Present a Python Module of the Week (10-15 minutes)
 * Have a learning-oriented presentation in addition to a normal expository presentation.
 * Close meetings with general Q&A time
 * Python Quiz of the Week; perhaps tie in to Module of the Week? (Matt)  The idea is to send out the quiz early in the week, people submit their solutions/answers throughout the week, and at the end of the week we can reveal the solution(s) and comment on various approaches and idioms.

Other Ideas & Comments
======================

 * Host snippets for writing up things you've figured out  (Greg)
 * Encouraging employers to sponsor time, allowing employees to mentor learners during work hours. (Darryl)
 * Accumulate feedback for various web tutorials as APUG members go through them, so we can help improve those upstream materials.
 * Get sponsors to provide internship opportunities once someone finishes a course or curriculum.
 * Motivate sponsors by allowing them (or their employees) to get a first interaction with potential new hires.  (Ross)
 * When someone joins APUG and expresses a desire to learn Python, immediately try to connect them with a mentor who they can ask questions of, one-on-one, which they might not be comfortable with asking on a wider mailing list. (Jake)
 * In addition to learning, doing a "getting set up" workshop maybe once a month would really help new users get started. You leave with a guaranteed working Python installation, and if you bring an idea of some small program you want to build, we'll try to help you get that built. (Jake)
 * Use <a href="http://www.bigbluebutton.org/">BigBlueButton</a> or <a href="https://join.me/">join.me</a> to help learners when they get stuck.
 * Have a questionnaire for when people join APUG, asking them what they would like to learn and what kinds of activities are most engaging for me.
 * There is a lot of value in doing an intensive Boot Camp, 1 or 2 days on a weekend that go from zero to having a working knowledge of Python (El Sid)
 * We need to better advertise the resources that APUG and AWPUG already have available for folks: the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/austin-python">austin-python@googlegroups.com mailing list</a>, the #austinpy IRC channel on Freenode, etc.


Mentors
=======

The following folks came up to me afterwards and offered their time and services to the cause.  Kudos and thanks to them, and hopefully others will join their ranks!

 * Jon Riehl: Would be particularly interested in teaching Python to non-programmers
 * Aaron Reba: Functional aspects of Python, numpy, scipy
 * Jake Basile: Flask
 * Josh Marshall
 * Eric Plaster
